- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dhina-Rajmohan
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET Technologies (if that makes sense, I'm sort of new to the whole coding thing)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Objective-C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any beginner friendly projects (not quite sure about collaborating since I don't have much to contribute)
